# Decompressor

## Purpose
This is a LZW decompressor build for Stareleaf.
[Lempel–Ziv–Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch) is a universal lossless data compression algorithm.

## Spec
It's build in Java and no libraries. Given a compressed filed, it parses it and outputs a new decompressed one in the same directory. Fully functional, however it doesn't handle memory efficiently.
